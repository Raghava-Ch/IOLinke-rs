== Recent Updates

* *Implementation Phase Complete*: All core components have been implemented and are feature-complete
* *Host Testing In Progress*: ISDU, OD, and PD modules have passed initial host-based testing
* *Target Testing Pending*: Hardware validation on actual IO-Link devices is scheduled

== Outstanding Issues

* Target hardware testing not yet initiated - requires physical IO-Link master and test setup
* IOLinke-Bindings require validation with C-based firmware integration
* Extended testing scenarios for edge cases and error conditions pending
* The current host testing architecture is unstable and may yield inconsistent results across runs.

== Next Steps

=== Immediate Priorities

1. *Target Hardware Testing*
   - Set up physical test environment with IO-Link master
   - Validate ISDU transfers on actual hardware
   - Test PD and OD operations in real-world scenarios

2. *Bindings Validation*
   - Complete C binding integration tests
   - Validate FFI interface with sample C applications

3. *Extended Testing*
   - Add stress testing scenarios
   - Validate timing requirements per IO-Link v1.1.4 specification
   - Test interoperability with multiple IO-Link master implementations

=== Future Enhancements

* Establish a robust, configurable host testing framework to ensure consistent, repeatable test execution across diverse configurations and environments
* Implement diagnostic and monitoring features
* Create comprehensive integration test suite
* Develop automated hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing framework
